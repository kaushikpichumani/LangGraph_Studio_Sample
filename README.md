# 🧠 LangGraph ReAct Agent with Memory (Python)

This repository contains a **LangGraph ReAct agent implemented in Python**, with support for **tool calling, persistent memory, and LangGraph Studio visualization**.

It serves as a **minimal but complete reference** for:
- Building a ReAct-style agent
- Using LangGraph memory (`MemorySaver`)
- Running the agent locally
- Visualizing and testing the graph using **LangGraph Studio**

---

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

- ✅ ReAct (Reason + Act) agent pattern
- ✅ Tool-augmented reasoning
- ✅ Persistent conversation memory
- ✅ Graph-based execution using LangGraph
- ✅ Ready-to-run with LangGraph Studio
